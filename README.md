# Gymify üí™

Gymify is a fitness tracking app designed to help users log and track their workouts effortlessly. With Gymify, you can search for exercises, log your sets, reps, and weight, and view your workout history in an organized and intuitive way. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned gym-goer, Gymify makes it easy to stay on top of your fitness goals.

This problem is being solved because i started working out last summer and i wanted a fitness app to track my progress, but all the ones i downloaded either costed a monthly subscription fee or didnt do what i wanted, so i created my own.

## Technical Approach üõ†Ô∏èüß†
The development of Gymify focused on creating a scalable and responsive mobile application from the ground up:

Component-Based Architecture: Designed reusable components for screens and UI elements to promote scalability and maintainability.

State Management with Context API: Implemented Context API to manage user authentication, workout logs, and app state efficiently without the overhead of external libraries.

Firebase Firestore Integration: Chose Firestore for real-time syncing of user data, ensuring instant reflection of logged workouts and exercise history across devices.

Environment Management: Used a .env file and app.config.js to securely manage Firebase and API keys, allowing flexibility for development and production environments.

Third-Party API Integration: Integrated the USDA nutrition API for meal search features, demonstrating secure external API consumption.

Mobile-First Design: Prioritized intuitive navigation, quick data entry, and clean interfaces, built specifically for iOS and Android devices using React Native and Expo.

## Risk Management Approach ‚ö°üîí
Throughout development, the following risk management strategies were applied:

Data Security: Sensitive Firebase configuration keys were stored securely in environment variables, never hardcoded into the codebase.

Error Handling and Validation: Implemented error boundaries and input validation for user actions like logging workouts or adding exercises to avoid app crashes and bad data submission.

Version Control and Branch Management: Used Git branching strategies (feature branches, pull requests) to minimize merge conflicts and enable clean version control.

Scalability Planning: Designed the database and app structure with scalability in mind, allowing for easy addition of future features like social workouts.

Backup Strategy: Firestore‚Äôs real-time data redundancy ensured that user workout logs would not be lost due to single-point failures.
